Agent: Thank you for calling, Ms. Thompson. Let me pull up your order details. The Evening Gown in midnight blue does have natural variation due to the silk fabric's weave - each piece is unique. This is mentioned in the product description and is considered a feature of authentic silk. Is the variation significant? Customer: Oh, I see. No, it's subtle and actually quite beautiful.

Our yoga pants actually have a stretchy fabric blend and tend to run true to size. For reference, the Medium fits waist 28-30 inches. If you're at the higher end or prefer a looser fit, I'd recommend the Large. We also have free returns if the fit isn't perfect. Customer: I think I'll go with Medium then. My waist is 29 inches.
